      <p>
      The national language and official language of Bangladesh is Bangla 
      according to the third article <br> the Constitution of Bangladesh.
      The second most spoken language in Bangladesh is claimed to be <br> Burmese 
      which is spoken by the Marma tribe in Chittagong Hill districts as the 
      districts border<br> Myanmar; it is also spoken by the Rohingya people. Almost 
      99% of Bangladeshis speak Bengali as <br>their first language. Bengali Language 
      Implementation Act, 1987 made it mandatory to use Bengali <br>in all government 
      affairs except in the cases of foreign relations. According to a 2022 census, <br>
      Bengali is predominantly spoken by 99% of the country's population and it also 
      serves as the national <br>language of the nation. The indigenous people of northern 
      and southeastern Bangladesh speak a <br>variety of native languages. Bangladesh has 
      44 indigenous languages according to Professor Shameem Reza.
